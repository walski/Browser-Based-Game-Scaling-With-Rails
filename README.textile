h2. Introduction

p.  In this paper I will explore if it is possible to develop a 
    Massively Multiplayer Online Browser-Based Game (MMOBG) with Ruby and Rails
    which is able to handle the same load as the existing MMOBG 
    "Tribal Wars":http://www.tribalwars.net/ while not exceeding the costs of
    operation of Tribal Wars.
